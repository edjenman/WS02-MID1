James Isaac “Jimmy” Neutron (born March 14, 1991) is the titular protagonist of the television series and the 2001 movie. He is the world’s smartest 10-year-old. He is named after scientists Sir Isaac Newton, and James Chadwick who was nicknamed “Jimmy Neutron”, because of his discovery of the neutron.          

Jimmy is a genius inventor, but his inventions seem to cause more destruction than anything good, and it is usually up to him and his friends to stop them. He lives in Retroville with his robot dog, Goddard, who is named after Robert H. Goddard (a pioneer in modern rocketry) and his parents, Hugh Neutron, a bumbling used car salesman and lover, and his caring housewife mother Judy Neutron.</p>
